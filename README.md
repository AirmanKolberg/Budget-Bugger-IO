# Budget Bugger

This app is a finance tracker I've built, since all other finance trackers 
I've ever used just never fit my exact needs.  This app takes your total 
income(s) and outgoing(s) and divvies up your money on a daily basis, 
showing you- not the money that you have- but the money that you have to 
spend.

There exists already an app on the Apple App Store called "Daily Budget", 
which attempts to tackle this same concept, however, I've found that app 
underwhelming.  Budget Bugger will allow you to keep track of, manage, and 
edit your data in an easy and simplistic way, allowing the users to have 
better confidence that the number being showed as your daily allowance, is 
in fact your daily allowance.

## Updates

This app will run off of a simple Flask server, and will utilise an API, a 
series of APIs, or a custom-built Selenium webscraper to retrieve financial 
data.
